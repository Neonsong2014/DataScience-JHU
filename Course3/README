Steps to execute R scripts in run_analysis.R file
===========================================================================================
1. Download the data set from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Unzip the dataset to your RStudio or R desktop application's default workspace file directory location.  It will create a folder as UCI HAR Dataset.
3. Keep all file names unchanged inside folder UCI HAR Dataset.
4. Download run_analysis.R file to your RStudio or R desktop application's default workspace.
5. Use source command to load the run_analysis.R.
6. Execute run_analysis method.  It takes less than 30 seconds to create an ouput data set specified by the project assignment and save it as a text file to workspace.
7. The output text file name and location is printed out on the console.
8. In case any file name is changed the script will stop with error messages.


Data transformation steps that run_analysis.R scripts performs to produce the final output text file as required by the project assignment.
==========================================================================================
1.  Create a training data record data frame using X_train.txt in train data set.
2.  Create a feature data frame using features.txt.
2.  Set the column header names of the data record data frame using a feature vector extracted from the feature data frame.
3.  Create a subject data frame using subject_train.txt in train data set.  This data frame has one numeric column that is the subject ranging from 1 to 30.  Set column name as subject.
4.  Create an activity label data frame using y_train.txt in train data set.  This data frame has one numeric column that is the activity id that matches the activity id in activity_label.txt file.  Set its column header as activityid.
5.  Add a new column, recordindex to the activity label data frame from step 4 using its own row index. Recordindex is used to keep activity label order in synch with data record order in training data set X_train.txt.
6.  Create an activity label lookup data frame using activity_labels.txt.  Set its column headers to activityid, activity respectively.  Activity column has description for each activity id.
7.  Merge activity label lookup data frame with activity label data frame on their activityid columns to create a new activity label data frame that has activity column.  Sort the new activity label data frame by its recordindex so its activity column is ordered by index of the data records.
8.  The newly created activity label data frame in step 7 should have the same number of rows as training data record data frame in step 1, which is 7352.
9.  The newly created subject data frame should have the same number of rows as training data record data frame in step 1, which is 7352.
10. Add activity label data frame to training data record data frame via column binding so activity and recordindex columns are the first two columns in the updated training data record data frame. 
11. Add subject data frame to the newly created training data record data frame in step 10 via column binding so subject column is the first column of the updated training data record data frame.
12. Repeat step 1 to 11 with X_test.txt, subject_test.txt, y_test.txt in test data set to produce a testing data record data frame with 2947 rows.
13. Combine training data frame with testing data frame via row binding to create an all data records data frame that contains 10299 data records with columns names as subject, activitytid, activity, recordindex plus all 561 features (variables).
14. Extract subject, activity columns and other columns contains “mean()” or “std()” from the all data records data frame in step 13 into a new data frame.
15. Group the new data frame at step 14 by its subject, activity columns, and then average each other columns to produce a final output data frame that contains 180 rows of mean data, each with 81 variables including subject, activity and other 79 variables,  in 6 activity categories for 30 subjects.
16. The final data frame is saved to a text file named as accelerometer-gyroscope-mean-std-dataset.txt in RStudio’s default workspace.
